The stock market is a market that enables the seamless exchange of buying and selling of company stocks. Every Stock Exchange has its own Stock Index value. The index is the average value that is calculated by combining several stocks.
This helps in representing the entire stock market and predicting the market’s movement over time. The stock market can have a huge impact on people and the country’s economy as a whole. Therefore, predicting the stock trends in an efficient manner can minimize the risk of loss and maximize profit.

The stock market works through a network of exchanges — you may have heard of the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or Sensex. Companies list shares of their stock on an exchange through a process called an initial public offering or IPO. Investors purchase those shares, which allows the company to raise money to grow its business. Investors can then buy and sell these stocks among themselves, and the exchange tracks the supply and demand of each listed stock.

That supply and demand help determine the price for each security or the levels at which stock market participants — investors and traders — are willing to buy or sell.
